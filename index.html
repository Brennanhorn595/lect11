<p>In the early twentieth century, small balls of stone, identified by archaeologists as marbles, were found on excavation near Mohenjo-daro.</p>
<p>:553 Marbles are often mentioned in Roman literature, as in Ovid's poem Nux (which mentions playing the game with walnuts), and there are many examples of marbles from excavations of sites associated with Chaldeans of Mesopotamia and ancient Egypt. They were commonly made of clay, stone or glass. Marbles arrived in Britain, imported from the Low Countries, during the medieval era.[2]</p>
<p>  In 1503 the town council of Nuremberg, Germany, limited the playing of marble games to a meadow outside the town.[3]</p>
<p>  It is unknown where marbles were first manufactured,[4] but the "original" marbles were designated made in Germany The game has become popular throughout the US and other countries.[dead link][6] Ceramic marbles entered inexpensive mass production in the 1870s.[citation needed]</p>

    A German glassblower invented marble scissors, a device for making marbles, in 1846.[7]:148 The first mass-produced toy marbles (clay) made in the US were made in Akron, Ohio, by S. C. Dyke, in the early 1890s. Some of the first US-produced glass marbles were also made in Akron, by James Harvey Leighton. In 1903, Martin Frederick Christensen—also of Akron, Ohio—made the first machine-made glass marbles on his patented machine. His company, The M. F. Christensen & Son Co., manufactured millions of toy and industrial glass marbles until they ceased operations in 1917. The next US company to enter the glass marble market was Akro Agate. This company was started by Akronites in 1911, but located in Clarksburg, West Virginia. Today, there are only two American-based toy marble manufacturers: Jabo Vitro in Reno, Ohio, and Marble King, in Paden City, West Virginia.[8]</p>
